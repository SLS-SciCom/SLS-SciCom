- 👋 Hi, I’m @SLS-SciCom
- 👀 I’m interested in the sciences, science education and science communication.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end web development and digital design to communicate science in more visual ways.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with researchers in the sciences to help them present their methods and findings clearly, concisely and creatively to their many important audiences. We can collaborate to develop accessible explanations of your work, visual metaphors and compelling research stories.  These can be used in a variety of face-to-face settings, research proposals, websites and other media platforms to reach potential students, funders, the media, and collaborators in and outside your field.
